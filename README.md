### Irgret, the Last Crystal Dragon
* Irgret is able to shoot magic that tracks the player and conjure a radial shield in the form of magic spheres that can harm the player if they hit them. These shield spheres are on a time, but may be consumed to protect Irgret when the palyer's magic hits them. Slaying a dragon is no simple task. The player will have to make sure to visit some secret and hidden rooms to become powerful enough for this task.</br>
